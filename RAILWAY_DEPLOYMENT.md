```

### Step 4: Get Your Backend URL
After deployment, Railway will show your app URL like:
`https://your-app-name.railway.app`

### Step 5: Test Your Backend
Visit: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/profile`
- Should return 401 (not authenticated) - this means it's working!

- âœ… Full app functionality works

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Build failed"**
   - Check Railway logs
   - Ensure all dependencies in requirements.txt

2. **"App not starting"**
   - Check environment variables are set
   - Verify SECRET_KEY is set

3. **"Database errors"**
   - DATABASE_URL should be: `sqlite:///cctv_chat.db`
   - Database will be created automatically

4. **"Connection refused"**
   - Wait for Railway to finish deployment
   - Check if app is running in Railway dashboard

## ðŸ“Š Railway Dashboard

Once deployed, you can:
- View logs in real-time
